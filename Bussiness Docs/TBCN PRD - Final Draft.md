## **9\. CONSTRAINTS & TRADE-OFFS**

### **9.1 Technical Constraints**

**Budget Constraints:**

* MVP development budget requires careful technology selection  
* Must prioritize cloud services with pay-as-you-grow pricing  
* Cannot afford enterprise-grade tools (Salesforce, Adobe Experience) initially

**Timeline Constraints:**

* 12-16 week MVP timeline requires strategic scope limitation  
* Advanced AI features (recommendation engine, chatbot) deferred to Phase 2  
* Mobile native apps deferred to Phase 2 (PWA as interim solution)

**Team Constraints:**

* Small development team requires focus on full-stack frameworks (Next.js)  
* Cannot build all integrations simultaneously—prioritize by user impact  
* Must rely on SaaS solutions over custom builds where feasible

**Infrastructure Constraints:**

* Must optimize for African internet speeds (3G/4G)  
* Must handle intermittent connectivity gracefully  
* Cannot assume high device specifications—must support older smartphones  
  ---

  ### **9.2 Regulatory Constraints**

**Data Protection:**

* Kenya Data Protection Act compliance mandatory  
* GDPR compliance required for European users  
* Must implement data localization if required by future regulations

**Financial Compliance:**

* PCI-DSS compliance via payment gateway delegation (not building own processing)  
* Must handle VAT/tax calculations correctly per jurisdiction  
* Must maintain transaction audit trails for 7 years

**Content Moderation:**

* Must implement systems to prevent illegal content sharing  
* Must comply with intellectual property laws (DMCA, local equivalents)  
* Must have clear terms of service and enforcement mechanisms  
  ---

  ### **9.3 Strategic Trade-Offs**

**Decision 1: Web-First vs. Mobile-First**

* **Choice:** Web-first with responsive design \+ PWA  
* **Trade-off:** Native app features (push notifications, offline-first) delayed  
* **Rationale:** Faster MVP launch, single codebase maintenance, lower development cost  
* **Mitigation:** PWA provides installable experience, native apps in Phase 2

**Decision 2: Build vs. Buy (Payment Processing)**

* **Choice:** Integrate Stripe/Flutterwave rather than build payment infrastructure  
* **Trade-off:** Transaction fees (2-3%), less control over flow  
* **Rationale:** PCI compliance complexity, faster time-to-market, proven reliability  
* **Mitigation:** Negotiate volume discounts, consider direct integration later

**Decision 3: Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture**

* **Choice:** Modular monolith initially  
* **Trade-off:** Harder to scale individual services independently  
* **Rationale:** Smaller team, faster development, lower infrastructure complexity  
* **Mitigation:** Design with clear module boundaries for future service extraction

**Decision 4: Custom LMS vs. Integration**
